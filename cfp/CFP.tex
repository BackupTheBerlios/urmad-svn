\begin{abstract}
In this paper we propose the \texttt{D-META} Grand Challenge, to set up the basis for comparison, analysis, and further
improvement of multimodal data annotations and multimodal interactive systems. Such machine learning-based challenges do
not exist in the Multimodal Interaction community. The main goal of this Grand Challenge is to foster research and
development in multimodal communication and to further elaborate algorithms and techniques for building various
multimodal applications. Held by two coupled pillars, method benchmarking and annotation evaluation, the \texttt{D-META}
challenge envisions a starting point for transparent and publicly available application and annotation evaluation on
multimodal data sets. The paper describes the motivations of the challenge, the conceptual background in which the
challenge is based as well as several practical issues necessary to set up the \texttt{D-META} challenge.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Machine learning-based tasks have been gaining importance in the last decades. This led to several interesting
challenges such as the PASCAL Visual Object Classes \cite{PascalVOC}, the Active Learning challenge
\cite{ActiveLearning} or the Speller \cite{Speller}. In addition, several tools have been developed to evaluate the
annotation also in the form of a challenge such as the Natural Language Generation Challenge \cite{Give} or
the Spoken Dialogue Challenge \cite{SDS}. Because the fields they are related to
(visual object recognition, active learning from unlabeled data, spell correction, ...) are mature, the
evaluation systems are accepted by the community. However, all these challenges are monomodal,
meaning that the data is acquired with one type of sensor.\vspace{0.4cm}

Similar challenges do not exist in the Multimodal Interaction community. Because we believe that this kind of
challenges are constructive, in this paper we suggest to setup a challenge so as to allow comparison,
analysis, and further development of multimodal data annotations and multimodal interactive systems. We believe that the
challenge has a positive impact on the field and that it will help to increase our understanding of the varied tasks and
activities related to the area. In addition, we are enthusiastic about it since this will provide for more robust and 
natural automatic systems, as well as guidelines towards shared methods and concepts so at to support comparison and
evaluation of such systems. Indeed, setting up the \texttt{D-META} challenge is demanding and even ambitious: the
diversity of targeted applications, the acquired data sets and their annotations, make the task a challenge in itself.
Some issues need to be addressed when proposing such challenges:
\begin{description}
 \item [Data sets] A few data sets need to be selected. These should be as much versatile as possible to in order to
handle different multimodal applications. In addition, the data sets should be publicly available and free, in order to
guarantee a fair participation in the challenge.
 \item [Evaluation metrics] They should be set up by the challenge in the call for papers, although we are looking
forward to the evolution of these metrics in order to be accepted by the community.
 \item [Annotations] They should be provided with the data set. We are interested also in evaluating these annotations
to converge towards consistently annotated data sets.
\end{description}

Following the Spoken Dialogue Challenge, we want to keep the first round fairly simple and clear, so as to obtain
feedback from the community and to gather experience for growing the challenge, in the coming years, to cover more
varied activities, tools and annotation levels.\vspace{0.4cm}

In the next, we describe the main properties of \texttt{D-META}. After the plan for participation, we outline
the proposed schedule. Before detailing the format of the challenge, we give some hints about who we are. At the end,
the references are provided.


\section{Description}
The main goal of the \texttt{D-META} Grand Challenge is to foster research and development in multimodal communication
and to enable further development of algorithms and techniques for building various multimodal applications. Although
we do not aim at providing an unified framework (cf. EMMA), we will start with a particular data set and a precise
annotation scheme, in order to benchmark methods targeted at diverse multimodal applications as well as evaluating
annotation systems. We hope that this framework will function as a starting point for researchers in the Multimodal
Interaction community to share their data sets in a structured fashion.\vspace{0.4cm}

The \texttt{D-META} challenge has these two fundamental and complementary pillars, method benchmarking and
annotation evaluation, and several objectives:
\begin{itemize}
\item To motivate and encourage research and development so as to understand the needs, requirements, possibilities, and
challenges that are to be addressed when developing multimodal interactive systems for real-world applications and
working systems.
\item To target ecologically valid data for automatic system development.
\item To provide evaluation criteria for assessing the performance of a system and to compare several systems with each
other.
\item To increase interest in the rich and multifaceted research area of multimodal interaction.
\end{itemize}

On one hand, since multimodal data sets are expensive (both in acquisition and annotation), they are often partially
annotated, just to satisfy the targeted application. Hence, the provided annotation may have place for
improvement. Providing annotations on data sets will ease two tasks: 1) the genesis of
cross-validated annotations and 2) the use of such data sets by the community. Thus, methods targeting multimodal
applications may be benchmarked using several common data sets in a transparent way.\vspace{0.4cm}

On the other hand, the set up of an application-oriented challenge will encourage researchers to work with other data
sets than theirs. Thus, annotations of these data sets will have to be rich and precise. Systematic evaluation
techniques will be required to provide for such annotations which, in turn, will be needed to have a clear
benchmarking of methods targeting multimodal applications.\vspace{0.4cm}

In summary, we envision \texttt{D-META} as a two coupled-branch challenge providing a starting point for research and
development aiming transparent and publicly available application and annotation evaluation on multimodal data sets.

\section{Participation plan}
In order to set up this Grand Challenge, we chose a few existing publicly-available multimodal data sets useful
for different multimodal applications and/or several annotation evaluations. This choice will be public within the call
for papers. Authors may submit their methods/benchmarks for applications and/or their systems/comparisons for
annotations and evaluation.\vspace{0.4cm}

The (non-closed) list of data sets in the \texttt{D-META} challenge is:
\begin{description}
 \item [RAVEL] The RAVEL data set was presented in \cite{Ravel}. Concerning the multimodal community, this data set
targets Audio-Visual person detection and tracking and Audio-Visual robot gesture recognition.
 \item [NOMCO] The NOMCO data set was presented in \cite{Paggio10}. It is used to empirically verify
how gestures and speech interact in feedback, turn management and sequencing.
\end{description}

We expect papers covering areas such as: (i) applications of an algorithm to a data set(s) to solve precise tasks,
(ii) benchmark of several algorithms using the same data set(s), (iii) extensions of the annotation scheme with new
relevant features, (iv) applications of the data to an automatic system, (v) discussions on ecologically valid data sets
and (vi) position papers of how to organise the next challenge. This will be detailed in the call for papers (CFP).

\section{Schedule}
The schedule has the following important dates:
\begin{description}
 \item[30-Jan-2012] Web site set up and the CFP\\
 The site will be ready by the end of January and it will contain the main ambitions of \texttt{D-META}, what do we
envision and organisation issues as well as the CFP. All the information related to the challenge will be published
there.
 \item[19-Mar-2012] Data set choice publicly available\\
 The data set choice will be ready before April, and we will explain what are we looking for (more precisely),
regarding the chosen data sets.
 \item[15-Jun-2012] Paper deadline
 \item[24-Aug-2012] Author notification
 \item[14-Sep-2012] Camera-ready
 \item[Oct-2012] Presentations at ICMI'2012
\end{description}

\section{Program Committee}
The program committee is right now work in progress, but it will contain people with background covering the following
fields:
\begin{itemize}
 \item multimodal interactive systems,
 \item machine learning,
 \item ecological data,
 \item multimodal signal processing and
 \item automatic system development.
\end{itemize}
People would be contacted in the following weeks, and the final committee will be published in the web site.

\section{Format}
Since the domain of the challenge we are proposing is quite vast, we would like to have a full-day workshop at
ICMI'2012. The challenge authors think that it is very important to keep the website up to date. Hence, we will need
web support. We would also like to have some funding for the coffee breaks and for the lunch of the attendees.
